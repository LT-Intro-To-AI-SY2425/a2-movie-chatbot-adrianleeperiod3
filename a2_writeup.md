# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

The most difficult part of completing the match function was accounting for given all cases involving % and _. Specifically for the %'s, the case given got way more complex everytime a % was involved, and even small changes such as a case involving two consecutive %'s would be way more complex and would need even more work to make a function match function.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

In a context involving large amounts of data, the match function can make it easier to retrieve data in a more natural way from the database. Rather than asking for an array index or specific data point, the match function allows a user to provide an actual sentence and recieve the information they request from it.
